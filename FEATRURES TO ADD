on our assets page. where we currently have our Assets Title, I would like to 2 tabs "Saved Assets" and "Generation History"
The Generation history should store a complete history (persistenet with prompts and all applicable metadata) of the users genereated conent from within the app (they should also have the option to delete any of them as well)
