if a user adds a link like https://civitai.com/api/download/models/2176505?type=Model&format=SafeTensor can we provided the option for the user to save that LoRA to their asset library "in a WAN LoRA" folder, so that they can quickly use the lora again at another time?

on our assets page. where we currently have our Assets Title, I would like to 2 tabs "Saved Assets" and "Generation History"
The Generation history should store a complete history (persistenet with prompts and all applicable metadata) of the users genereated conent from within the app (they should also have the option to delete any of them as well)
