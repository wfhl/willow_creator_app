# Bytedance

> A new-generation image creation model ByteDance, Seedream 4.5 integrates image generation and image editing capabilities into a single, unified architecture.


## Overview

- **Endpoint**: `https://fal.run/fal-ai/bytedance/seedream/v4.5/text-to-image`
- **Model ID**: `fal-ai/bytedance/seedream/v4.5/text-to-image`
- **Category**: text-to-image
- **Kind**: inference
**Tags**: stylized, transform



## API Information

This model can be used via our HTTP API or more conveniently via our client libraries.
See the input and output schema below, as well as the usage examples.


### Input Schema

The API accepts the following input parameters:


- **`prompt`** (`string`, _required_):
  The text prompt used to generate the image
  - Examples: "A selfie of a cat, with the cat as the protagonist. The setting is twilight at the Eiffel Tower. The cat is happy, holding a piece of baklava in its paw. The photo has a slight motion blur and is slightly overexposed. From a selfie angle, with a bit of motion blur, the overall image presents a sense of calm madness. The text \"Seedream 4.5 is on fal\" should be written on the picture at the top in clearly visible font and crisp lettering. The image has a 4:3 aspect ratio"

- **`image_size`** (`ImageSize | Enum`, _optional_):
  The size of the generated image. Width and height must be between 1920 and 4096, or total number of pixels must be between 2560*1440 and 4096*4096.
  - Default: `{"height":2048,"width":2048}`
  - One of: ImageSize | Enum
  - Examples: "auto_2K"

- **`num_images`** (`integer`, _optional_):
  Number of separate model generations to be run with the prompt. Default value: `1`
  - Default: `1`
  - Range: `1` to `6`

- **`max_images`** (`integer`, _optional_):
  If set to a number greater than one, enables multi-image generation. The model will potentially return up to `max_images` images every generation, and in total, `num_images` generations will be carried out. In total, the number of images generated will be between `num_images` and `max_images*num_images`. Default value: `1`
  - Default: `1`
  - Range: `1` to `6`

- **`seed`** (`integer`, _optional_):
  Random seed to control the stochasticity of image generation.

- **`sync_mode`** (`boolean`, _optional_):
  If `True`, the media will be returned as a data URI and the output data won't be available in the request history.
  - Default: `false`

- **`enable_safety_checker`** (`boolean`, _optional_):
  If set to true, the safety checker will be enabled. Default value: `true`
  - Default: `true`
  - Examples: true



**Required Parameters Example**:

```json
{
  "prompt": "A selfie of a cat, with the cat as the protagonist. The setting is twilight at the Eiffel Tower. The cat is happy, holding a piece of baklava in its paw. The photo has a slight motion blur and is slightly overexposed. From a selfie angle, with a bit of motion blur, the overall image presents a sense of calm madness. The text \"Seedream 4.5 is on fal\" should be written on the picture at the top in clearly visible font and crisp lettering. The image has a 4:3 aspect ratio"
}
```

**Full Example**:

```json
{
  "prompt": "A selfie of a cat, with the cat as the protagonist. The setting is twilight at the Eiffel Tower. The cat is happy, holding a piece of baklava in its paw. The photo has a slight motion blur and is slightly overexposed. From a selfie angle, with a bit of motion blur, the overall image presents a sense of calm madness. The text \"Seedream 4.5 is on fal\" should be written on the picture at the top in clearly visible font and crisp lettering. The image has a 4:3 aspect ratio",
  "image_size": "auto_2K",
  "num_images": 1,
  "max_images": 1,
  "enable_safety_checker": true
}
```


### Output Schema

The API returns the following output format:

- **`images`** (`list<Image>`, _required_):
  Generated images
  - Array of Image
  - Examples: [{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_outputs/seedreamv45/seedream_v45_t2i_output.png"}]

- **`seed`** (`integer`, _required_):
  Seed used for generation
  - Examples: 42



**Example Response**:

```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_outputs/seedreamv45/seedream_v45_t2i_output.png"
    }
  ],
  "seed": 42
}
```


## Usage Examples

### cURL

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://fal.run/fal-ai/bytedance/seedream/v4.5/text-to-image \
  --header "Authorization: Key $FAL_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
     "prompt": "A selfie of a cat, with the cat as the protagonist. The setting is twilight at the Eiffel Tower. The cat is happy, holding a piece of baklava in its paw. The photo has a slight motion blur and is slightly overexposed. From a selfie angle, with a bit of motion blur, the overall image presents a sense of calm madness. The text \"Seedream 4.5 is on fal\" should be written on the picture at the top in clearly visible font and crisp lettering. The image has a 4:3 aspect ratio"
   }'
```

### Python

Ensure you have the Python client installed:

```bash
pip install fal-client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```python
import fal_client

def on_queue_update(update):
    if isinstance(update, fal_client.InProgress):
        for log in update.logs:
           print(log["message"])

result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/bytedance/seedream/v4.5/text-to-image",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "A selfie of a cat, with the cat as the protagonist. The setting is twilight at the Eiffel Tower. The cat is happy, holding a piece of baklava in its paw. The photo has a slight motion blur and is slightly overexposed. From a selfie angle, with a bit of motion blur, the overall image presents a sense of calm madness. The text \"Seedream 4.5 is on fal\" should be written on the picture at the top in clearly visible font and crisp lettering. The image has a 4:3 aspect ratio"
    },
    with_logs=True,
    on_queue_update=on_queue_update,
)
print(result)
```

### JavaScript

Ensure you have the JavaScript client installed:

```bash
npm install --save @fal-ai/client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```javascript
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/bytedance/seedream/v4.5/text-to-image", {
  input: {
    prompt: "A selfie of a cat, with the cat as the protagonist. The setting is twilight at the Eiffel Tower. The cat is happy, holding a piece of baklava in its paw. The photo has a slight motion blur and is slightly overexposed. From a selfie angle, with a bit of motion blur, the overall image presents a sense of calm madness. The text \"Seedream 4.5 is on fal\" should be written on the picture at the top in clearly visible font and crisp lettering. The image has a 4:3 aspect ratio"
  },
  logs: true,
  onQueueUpdate: (update) => {
    if (update.status === "IN_PROGRESS") {
      update.logs.map((log) => log.message).forEach(console.log);
    }
  },
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);
```
